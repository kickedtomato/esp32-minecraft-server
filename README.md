# TODO
- [x] better way to buffer data and auto packet length calculation
- [x] general cleanup
- [ ] parse more packets sent from the client
- [ ] maybe add specific blocks for hardware interaction?
- [x] (8 bits per block now) better way of storing chunks
- [ ] support psram for greater room for more chunks and players
- [ ] save game progress
- [ ] maybe support more protocols? (takes a lor of effort)
- [ ] better client handling

# known issues
- sometimes when a client disconnects it may take several packets for the server to notice
- players with same username can join
- if you fall in the void you'll keep falling until the client eventually crashes
